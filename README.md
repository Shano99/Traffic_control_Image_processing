# Traffic Control System
A prototype of traffic control system that varies the timing of the traffic signal based on the number of vehicles at the junction of the particular lane.
Images captured from different cameras at the junction are processed using various image processing techniques in MATLAB.
The simulation of the system in realtime is performed in SUMO simulator.
